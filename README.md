# Image-Background-Rmover
This app allows you to easily remove backgrounds from your images. 
Upload any image (e.g., PNG, JPG, JPEG, or JFIF), and the app will automatically process it, giving you a clean image with the background removed.
How it Works:
Upload an image using the sidebar.
The app removes the background of the image using the rembg library.
View the original image alongside the processed one and download the result.
Before and After:
Hereâ€™s an example showing the difference between the original image and the one with the background removed:
