# Image-Background-Rmover
This app allows you to easily remove backgrounds from your images.  
Upload any image (e.g., PNG, JPG, JPEG, or JFIF), and the app will automatically process it, giving you a clean image with the background removed.  

## How it Works:  
1- Upload an image using the sidebar.  
2- The app removes the background of the image using the rembg library.  
3- View the original image alongside the processed one and download the result.  
  
## Before and After:  
Hereâ€™s an example showing the difference between the original image and the one with the background removed:
